# CPU VS IO Bound: or "why I hate waiting"

In order to understand asynchronous programming in javascript, we first need to understand why it's necessary

## Execution Basics:

In a computer the cpu fetches instructions an executes them, when a piece of work is entirely executed on the cpu we say that it is "cpu bound". What does it mean for a job to be cpu bound? It means that all data the cpu needs to operate is in ram or in CPU registers, and the cpu doesn't have to make any long running calls (to disk or to the network) in order to retrieve data. By comparison, anything that is not CPU bound is "IO bound", this means that the instruction the cpu is running is dependent on a slower method of data retrieval e.g. reading data from the disk or the network.

## Implications of IO bound work for programming:

During IO bound work, by definition the cpu is idle. The cpu is waiting for a response to some request for data, so there's nothing running. When the operating system sees the cpu waiting for IO to complete, it schedules a different process (or a different thread of the same process) to run while the currently blocked job is waiting for a result. The thread that the IO bound work is running on is therefore blocked until a result comes back from the external data source

## The Problem:

Now, having a thread block while waiting for data is usually fine in multithreaded languages. If one thread is blocked waiting for disk IO for example, it's easy to schedule another thread of the program to run. However:

**Javascript is a single threaded language. This means that you can't schedule another thread if the main thread is blocked. If the main thread is blocked the whole process grounds to a halt until data is returned**

What this means is that in javascript there is a zero tolerance policy for blocking threads while waiting on IO bound work or waiting on long running computations to complete. So how do we solve this?

## Solutions:

It turns out that there are actually two solutions for this problem, they are both used for different aspects of the same problem

- Solution 1: What if there were some way that we could tell the thread:
  `"hey this next thing you run is some IO bound work. So what I want you to do is to kick it off, and then go work on some other stuff and I'll let you know when it's done."` Well it turns out that is the fundamental idea underlying **asynchronous programming**, but more on that later

- Solution 2: Whenever we come across some IO bound work, we spin up a new process to handle it so that our main process isn't blocked by the IO bound work.

Well it turns out that solution #2 isn't very efficient. For every process that gets created the OS needs to keep track of a virtual address space, file handles, stacks, heaps and a bunch of other process related gunk. Especially considering that, if it's an IO bound workload, the new process is just going to be blocked most of the time anyway. **Solution 2 is much better for long running cpu bound work.** (Think of a web server that has a route which calulcates 100000 factorial, you don't want the web server to completley hang every time a client submits a request so you can have one process to respond to requests and another to calculate results)

So we now know that solution #1 is what we need for IO bound work, so how do we tell a thread to work on other stuff while we're waiting for results?If you guessed "an event loop" you either looked at the title of the next document, or you should probably be writing this instead of me.

# Async/Await, the solution to broken promises

The first thing to know about async/await is that they are just some fluff on top of promises, under the hood everything is being converted to promises by the interpreter. So what is async and await?

async and await are two javascript keywords introduced in es6. Basically the async keyword can be applied to a function like this:

```javascript
async function(arg1, arg2, arg3) {}
```

The async keyword does two important things

- It tells the javascript interpreter that this function will contain the await keyword, and that this keyword should be treated in a special manner (more on this in a little bit)
- It tells the javascript interpreter that this function will be returning a promise

The above are **ALWAYS** true when marking a function as async

## The await keyword

Ok, so we talked about the function of the async keyword, what about the await keyword?

**THE AWAIT KEYWORD ONLY HAS MEANING WHEN USED INSIDE OF AN FUNCTION MARKED AS ASYNC**

This means that if a function isn't marked as async, the await keyword should bever be used.

The await keyword is used within an async function to get the result of a function that returns a promise. Let's take our HTTP example from the last document:

Here is the example using .then and .catch:

```javascript
// Lets assume that the function makeHTTPCall returns a promise that resolves with some json data if it's successful, or an error object if it fails

makeHTTPCall()
	.then(
		(data) => {
			return JSON.parse(data);
		},
		(err) => {
			console.warn('Uh oh, something broke');
		}
	)
	.then((json) => {
		console.log(json);
	});
```

Now here is the same example using async/await

```javascript
async function getHTTPResult() {
	try {
		const data = await makeHTTPCall();
		const result = JSON.parse(data);
		console.log(result);
	} catch (err) {
		console.warn('Uh oh, something broke');
	}
}
```

```
The async and await keywords let us write asynchronous code that uses promises like it's synchronous code. It hides the complexity of async code and makes it easier to read.
```

Ok so as we can see above, we're using the await keyword to await a function that returns a pomise, and getting a value from it, as if it were just a regular function with a plain old return value. Whats actually happening here is that the interpreter is doing some magic under the hood. **The await keyword can only be used with a function that returns a promise.**

```
When the interpreter sees the await keyword it basically says `Ok, I know that this is a promise that finishes sometime in the future. So I'm going to take any code that comes after this await keyword and package it up as a callback to be run after the promise completes`
```

So what we see is this:

```javascript
async function getHTTPResult() {
	try {
		const data = await makeHTTPCall();
		const result = JSON.parse(data);
		console.log(result);
	} catch (err) {
		console.warn('Uh oh, something broke');
	}
}
```

But what the interpreter sees is this:

```javascript
function getHTTPResult() {
	return makeHTTPCall()
		.then(
			(data) => {
				return JSON.parse(data);
			},
			(err) => {
				console.warn('Uh oh, something broke');
			}
		)
		.then((json) => {
			console.log(json);
		});
}
```

The above example is a little reductive in that this isn't exactly what happens, what actually happens involves state machines and other complicated stuff, but it's close enough that it's an easy way to think about it.

Congrats! you've made it to the end of the session!
A couple takeaways to think about:

- Just because a function returns a promise does not mean you need to use the async keyword in the signature. **The only time you should mark a function as async is if you plan on using the await keyword inside the fucntion body**

- This is more a matter of personal preference: but I don't like when peopl mix using .then/.catch with promises, stick to using one or the other and try not to mix them unless you have to

- Remember that if your promise calls rej() and you await it, that rejection will be thrown in the awaited code. If you don't await it the error will bubble up the stack

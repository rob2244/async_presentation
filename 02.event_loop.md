# Going Loopy, an intro to event loops

So ehat the heck is an event loop anyway? Turns out, it's a scary word for a pretty simple concept:

So I'm a thread right, and I'm running along and I come across some IO bound work. Obviously I can't block because that would stop the execution of the entire program. So what do I do? I tell the OS: `"alright look buddy, I need you to tell me when this thing is done, ok. In fact here's a function that I want you to push onto my callback queue with the result data for me to run when this thing is complete. In the meantime I'm going to get some other work and run that while I keep an eye on my callback queue"`

A callback queue is just a regular queue of functions that need to be run. each function in the queue is associated with some result data that the execution environment got back from the call to the data store. Since it's a queue data structure, the functions are run in the order of arrival to the queue.

## Event Loop, a reduction:

So basically, in a super reduced form, an event loop boils down to the following

```javascript
const queue = [
	{
		data: 'Hello world',
		func: (d) => console.log(d),
	},
];

while (true) {
	d = queue.shift();
	if (!d) continue;
	d.func(d.data);
}
```

Now, the above is obviously a gross oversimplification of the topic (forgive me event loop experts!), however it serves as enough of an example in order to understand at a very high level how an event loop works.

## The Recap:

So, just to recap what we've learned so far:
When we're running javascript code we only have one thread of execution. If we block this one thread we halt the entire program until this thread is free to do other stuff again. Obviously we don't want to block the entire program, so the thread has to be working (running on the cpu) the whole time. So what do we do if there's a long running operation that doesn't do work on the cpu? (e.g. making a network call, reading a file from disk, etc.) Well,the thread tells the OS to begin the operation, and then gives the OS the location of a function to put on the callback queue with the result data when it's done. In the meantime the thread does other work it has while keeping an eye on it's callback queue for any callbacks it needs to run.

For the interested reade, node uses an event loop written in c called libuv

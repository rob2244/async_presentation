# Callbacks: the road to hell is paved with good intentions

So let's talk about callbacks now. You rmemeber callbacks? Those things that have a queue named after them which we discussed in the last section?

```
According to wikipedia: In computer programming, a callback, also known as a "call-after"[1] function, is any executable code that is passed as an argument to other code; that other code is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time.
```

So basically a callback is just a function that is passed in to another function, and then the function it's passed into calls it at some point:

```javascript
const adder = (x, y) => x + y;

function calculator(x, y, operation) {
	return operation(x, y);
}

calculator(5, 10, adder); // returns 15
```

Above we can see adder is a simple callback, it takes in two arguments and outputs the sum of those arguments. Calculator is a function that takes in two arguments and a callback and returns the results of runnign that callback with the two arguments passed in.

## Callbacks and event loops, the joining

Recall in the last section we talked about the event loop and the callback queue, in this case the event loop is like the calculate function, in that it reads a list of callbacks of off a queue and passes in the result data recieved from an IO bound operation.

It turns out that since node is built on top of an event loop, all of the apis exposed by node to access data from a long running source takes in a callback. Take a look at the following common node apis:

```
fs.copyFile(src, dest[, mode], callback)
fs.exists(path, callback)
fs.opendir(path[, options], callback)
http.get(url[, options][, callback])
http.request(options[, callback])

In point of fact, node usually has 2 versions of any given function that is IO bound, a synchronous one that blocks the thread (usually we want to avoid this version) and an asynchronous one that accepts a call back as an argument
```

As you can see the last argument to all of the node apis above is a callback function to be called after the request retruns some data. In fact, callbacks in node have a common form where the first argument passed to the callback is an error (this will be null if there was no error) and the second value is the result of the IO bound work.

## Where the callback approach fails

The callback approach to IO bound work mentioned above works, but it has one fatal flaw: What if I want to nest callback calls. For example, say I want to read a file, then copy it based on if it has a certain file contents, then send it in an http post request:

```javascript
fs.readfile('/etc/passwd', (err, data) => {
	if (err) throw err;
	if (data.includes('robin')) {
		fs.copyFile('/etc/passwd', '/opt/passwd_copy', () => {
			const options = {
				hostname: 'www.google.com',
				port: 80,
				path: '/upload',
				method: 'POST',
				headers: {
					'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
					'Content-Length': Buffer.byteLength(postData),
				},
			};

			http.request(options, (res) => {
				console.log(`STATUS: ${res.statusCode}`);
				console.log(`HEADERS: ${JSON.stringify(res.headers)}`);
				res.setEncoding('utf8');
				res.on('data', (chunk) => {
					console.log(`BODY: ${chunk}`);
				});
				res.on('end', () => {
					console.log('No more data in response.');
				});
			});
		});
	}
});
```

As you can see in the above code nesting callbacks quickly becomes a **BIG** problem where readability is concerned. This is colloquially known as "callback hell". In order to combat callback hell, an abstraction called a **promise** was created to make async programming easier.
